tElasticsearchIndexJson
=======================

See README in tElasticsearchIndex for detailed information on background and setup of Talend ElasticSearch components.


Description
===========

This componenent is an offshoot of the tElasticsearchIndex componenent.  Instead of converting the Talend schema to JSON within the component, this component will take a field already converted into a string and perform bulk indexing into Elasticsearch.

Define field that contains JSON string in "Body Field" field.
